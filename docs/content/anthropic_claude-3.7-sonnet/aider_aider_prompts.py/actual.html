Review the provided context and diffs which are about to be committed to a git repo.
Review the diffs carefully.
Generate a one-line commit message for those changes.
The commit message should be structured as follows: <type>: <description>
Use these for <type>: fix, feat, build, chore, ci, docs, style, refactor, perf, test

Ensure the commit message:
- Starts with the appropriate prefix.
- Is in the imperative mood (e.g., \"add feature\" not \"added feature\" or \"adding feature\").
- Does not exceed 72 characters.

Reply only with the one-line commit message, without any additional text, explanations, \
or line breaks.

This is only part of a longer conversation so *DO NOT* conclude the summary with language like "Finally, ...". Because the conversation continues after the summary.
The summary *MUST* include the function names, libraries, packages that are being discussed.
The summary *MUST* include the filenames that are being referenced by the assistant inside the ```...``` fenced code blocks!
The summaries *MUST NOT* include ```...``` fenced code blocks!

Phrase the summary with the USER in first person, telling the ASSISTANT about the conversation.
Write *as* the user.
The user should refer to the assistant as *you*.
