            <pre><code class="language-plaintext">This file has undergone significant changes over time. Here are some key changes I noticed:

1. The test suite was converted from using ReactDOM.render to using the new ReactDOMClient.createRoot API.

2. Many tests were updated to use async/await and act() for handling asynchronous rendering.

3. Error handling and testing was updated, including changes to how errors are thrown and caught.

4. Support for rendering BigInt values was added.

5. Tests for legacy context APIs were updated to check for deprecation warnings.

6. Some tests were added or modified to handle cross-window rendering scenarios.

7. The way warnings and errors are asserted was updated to use new helper functions.

8. Some feature flags were removed or changed, like enableBigIntSupport and enableOwnerStacks.

9. The overall structure of the tests remained similar, but many implementation details were updated to reflect changes in React's behavior and APIs.

10. There were various refactorings and code style updates throughout the file's history.

These changes reflect the evolution of React, including new features, deprecated APIs, and changes in how React handles certain scenarios like error boundaries and asynchronous rendering.</code></pre>
