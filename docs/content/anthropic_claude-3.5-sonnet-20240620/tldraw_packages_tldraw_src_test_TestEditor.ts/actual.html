            <pre><code class="language-plaintext">Here's a summary of the changes made to the TestEditor class in the tldraw package:

1. The constructor was updated to accept additional options for text handling, including font loading and TipTap extensions for rich text editing.

2. The `measureText` method was updated to include a `padding` option.

3. A new `measureHtml` method was added to measure HTML content, stripping out tags and converting paragraph breaks to newlines.

4. The `measureTextSpans` method was updated to use the new `measureText` signature.

5. Various input handling methods (like `pointerMove`, `keyDown`, etc.) were updated to include additional key modifiers (metaKey, accelKey) and use the `isAccelKey` helper function.

6. New methods were added for handling pinch gestures (`pinchStart`, `pinchTo`, `pinchEnd`).

7. A `getHistory` method was added to expose the editor's history.

8. A `forceTick` method was added to manually trigger update cycles.

9. Methods for creating shapes from JSX were updated to handle assets.

10. The `expectShapeToMatch` method was made more flexible with generic types.

11. New methods were added for checking page and screen bounds of shapes.

These changes reflect the evolution of the tldraw editor, particularly in areas of text handling, rich text support, input management, and testing utilities. The TestEditor class now provides more comprehensive tools for simulating user interactions and verifying the state of the editor in test scenarios.</code></pre>
