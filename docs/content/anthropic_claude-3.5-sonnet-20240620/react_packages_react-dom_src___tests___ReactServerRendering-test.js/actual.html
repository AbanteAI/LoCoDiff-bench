            <pre><code class="language-plaintext">This file shows the evolution of the `ReactServerRendering-test.js` test file in the React codebase. Here are the key changes over time:

1. Initially, the file contained tests for server-side rendering using `ReactDOMServer`.

2. Various tests were added and modified to cover different aspects of server rendering, including handling of props, context, suspense, errors, and warnings.

3. The testing approach evolved from using `expect().toWarnDev()` to `assertConsoleErrorDev()` for checking console warnings and errors.

4. Support for new React features like Suspense and Context API was added over time.

5. Tests were updated to handle changes in React's internal implementation, such as the removal of the Partial Renderer.

6. Warnings and error messages were updated to be more informative and consistent.

7. Tests were added to cover edge cases and potential issues with server rendering.

8. The file was updated to use newer Jest features and testing patterns.

9. Tests were adjusted to account for changes in React's behavior regarding legacy APIs and new features.

10. The testing strategy evolved to handle different build configurations (e.g., experimental flags) more gracefully.

11. Component stack information in error messages became more detailed and accurate over time.

12. Some APIs like `renderToNodeStream` were deprecated and removed, with corresponding test updates.

13. Tests were added for custom elements and their behavior in server rendering.

14. The file was kept up-to-date with changes in React's public and internal APIs.

This history reflects the ongoing development and refinement of React's server-side rendering capabilities, as well as improvements in the testing infrastructure for the React codebase.</code></pre>
