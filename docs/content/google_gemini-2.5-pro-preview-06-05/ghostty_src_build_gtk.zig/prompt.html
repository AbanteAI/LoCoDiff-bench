You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

commit 8bf5c4ed7f8e39ca6dcadd036c8c72924590b200

    This is a major refactor of `build.zig`.
    
    The major idea behind the refactor is to split the `build.zig` file up into
    distinct `src/build/*.zig` files. By doing so, we can improve readability of
    the primary `build.zig` while also enabling better reuse of steps. Our
    `build.zig` is now less than 150 lines of code (of course, it calls into a lot
    more lines but they're neatly organized now).
    
    Improvements:
    
      * `build.zig` is less than 150 lines of readable code.
      * Help strings and unicode table generators are only run once when multiple
        artifacts are built since the results are the same regardless of target.
      * Metal lib is only built once per architecture (rather than once per artifact)
      * Resources (shell integration, terminfo, etc.) and docs are only
        built/installed for artifacts that need them
    
    Breaking changes:
    
      * Removed broken wasm build (@gabydd will re-add)
      * Removed conformance files, shell scripts are better and we don't run
        these anymore
      * Removed macOS app bundle creation, we don't use this anymore since we
        use Xcode
    
    ## Some History
    
    Our `build.zig` hasn't been significantly refactored since the project started,
    when Zig was _version 0.10_. Since then, the build system has changed
    significantly. We've only ever duct taped the `build.zig` as we needed to
    support new Zig versions, new features, etc. It was a mess.
    
    The major improvement is adapting the entire Ghostty `build.zig` to the Step
    and LazyPath changes introduced way back in Zig 0.12. This lets us better take
    advantage of parallelism and the dependency graph so that steps are only
    executed as they're needed.
    
    As such, you can see in the build.zig that we initialize a lot of things, but
    unless a final target (i.e. install, run) references those steps, _they'll
    never be executed_. This lets us clean up a lot.

    gtk: implement quick terminal
    
    Using `gtk4-layer-shell` still seems like the path of least resistance,
    and to my delight it pretty much Just Works. Hurrah!
    
    This implementation could do with some further polish (e.g. animations,
    which can be implemented via libadwaita's animations API, and global
    shortcuts), but as a MVP it works well enough.
    
    It even supports tabs!
    
    Fixes #4624.

    gtk: build gtk4-layer-shell ourselves
    
    As of now `gtk4-layer-shell` is unavailable on recent, stable releases
    of many distros (Debian 12, Ubuntu 24.04, openSUSE Leap & Tumbleweed, etc.)
    and outdated on many others (Nixpkgs 24.11/unstable, Fedora 41, etc.)
    This is inconvenient for our users and severely limits where the quick
    terminal can be used. As a result we then build gtk4-layer-shell ourselves
    by default unless `--system` or `-fsys=gtk4-layer-shell` are specified.
    This also allows me to add an idiomatic Zig API on top of the library
    and avoiding adding even more raw C code in the GTK apprt.
    
    Since we now build gtk4-layer-shell it should be theoretically available
    on all Linux systems we target. As such, the `-Dgtk-layer-shell` build
    option has been removed. This is somewhat of an experimental change as
    I don't know if gtk4-layer-shell works perfectly across all distros, and
    we can always add the option back if need be.
