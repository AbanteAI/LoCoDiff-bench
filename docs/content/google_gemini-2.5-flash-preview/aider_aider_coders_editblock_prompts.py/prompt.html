You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

# File History

    Switch from "edit block" to "search/replace block"
    
    Succeeded in tricky task in the grep-ast codebase:
    - checkout ed714ffe58734 / tricky-search-and-replace-state
    - "read and parse .gitignore once, not each time we recurse `enumerate_files`"
    - was having a lot of trouble creating a head/updated block that matched the actual source code
    - new search/replace block does much better
    
    Benchmark had *best* try 1 result and *lowest* num_error_outputs ever seen on gpt-4-0613.
    Low num_error_outputs means it's less likely to elide/... code in the before block (original/search).
