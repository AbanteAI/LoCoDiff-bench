Looking at the entire history of `src/main.rs`, I can trace how Qdrant has evolved from a simple vector database to a comprehensive vector search engine. Here's my comprehensive analysis:

## Evolution of Qdrant's Architecture

### 1. **Early Foundation (May-June 2020)**
The project started as a simple experiment with:
- Basic WAL (Write-Ahead Log) testing
- Settings configuration
- Simple serialization tests with bincode
- Collection operations structure

### 2. **Web Service Integration (June 2020)**
- Added Actix Web server for REST API
- Introduced basic HTTP endpoints
- Set up logging with env_logger

### 3. **Core Storage Development (2020-2021)**
- Moved from simple structs to a Table of Contents (ToC) system
- Implemented collection management
- Added segment-based storage architecture
- Introduced search and update operations

### 4. **API Expansion (2021)**
- Added comprehensive REST endpoints (collections, points, search)
- Integrated gRPC alongside REST
- Implemented recommendation API
- Added scroll/pagination support

### 5. **Distributed System Features (2022)**
- **Consensus with Raft**: Full distributed consensus implementation
- **Cluster Management**: Peer-to-peer communication
- **Shard Management**: Distributed sharding with transfer capabilities
- Added internal gRPC for cluster communication
- Bootstrap mechanism for cluster initialization

### 6. **Performance Optimizations (2022-2023)**
- **Memory Management**: 
  - Jemalloc integration for better memory allocation
  - Mmap advice configuration
  - Async I/O with io_uring on Linux
- **CPU Management**:
  - Dynamic CPU saturation control
  - Resource budget system for optimizations
  - Separate runtime pools for search/update/general operations

### 7. **Enterprise Features (2023-2024)**
- **Security**:
  - TLS support
  - API key authentication
  - RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- **Operations**:
  - Snapshot/recovery mechanisms
  - Health checks and readiness probes
  - Telemetry and monitoring
- **Advanced Storage**:
  - Non-blocking snapshots
  - WAL delta transfers
  - Recovery mode for disaster recovery

### 8. **Recent Innovations (2024-2025)**
- **AI Integration**:
  - Inference service for embeddings
  - GPU support for HNSW indexing
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Resource budgets (CPU and I/O)
  - Feature flags system
  - Issues API for operational insights
  - Dynamic logger configuration
- **Resharding**: Dynamic collection resharding capabilities

## Key Architectural Components

### Core Systems
1. **Storage Layer**: Table of Contents → Collections → Shards → Segments
2. **Consensus Layer**: Raft-based distributed consensus
3. **API Layer**: REST (Actix) + gRPC (Tonic)
4. **Runtime Management**: Separate Tokio runtimes for different workloads

### Configuration & Deployment
- Environment variable support
- Cluster bootstrapping
- Peer metadata tracking
- Hardware detection and reporting

### Operational Excellence
- Comprehensive logging with tracing
- Deadlock detection
- Panic handling with telemetry
- Recovery modes
- Health monitoring

## Technical Decisions

1. **Memory Allocator**: Switched to jemalloc for better performance
2. **Async I/O**: Optional io_uring support on Linux
3. **Resource Management**: Budget-based CPU/IO allocation
4. **Consensus**: Raft for distributed state management
5. **API Design**: Dual REST/gRPC support for flexibility

## Current State (2025)

The modern Qdrant is a sophisticated distributed vector database with:
- Full horizontal scalability through sharding
- High availability through replication
- Enterprise security features
- GPU acceleration support
- AI model integration
- Comprehensive operational tooling

The evolution shows a clear progression from a simple vector storage system to an enterprise-ready, distributed vector search engine capable of handling production workloads at scale.
