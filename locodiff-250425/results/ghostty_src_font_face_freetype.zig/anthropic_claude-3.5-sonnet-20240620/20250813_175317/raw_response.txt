Here's a summary of the key changes made to the FreeType font face implementation in Zed:

1. Metrics calculation was moved out of the Face struct and into a separate getMetrics() method. This allows metrics to be calculated on-demand rather than stored.

2. Support for bitmap fonts was improved by enabling bitmap strikes for non-color fonts.

3. SVG glyph support was disabled since Zed doesn't currently have a way to render SVG glyphs.

4. The check for whether a glyph is colored was simplified to just look at the pixel mode of the rendered bitmap.

5. Emoji/color glyph resizing was updated to constrain glyphs to fit within 2 cell widths maximum, rather than always scaling to fill vertically.

6. Various minor optimizations and code cleanup throughout.

The overall structure remains similar, with the Face struct wrapping a FreeType face and providing methods to render glyphs, get metrics, etc. But the internals were refined to improve performance and correctness, especially around handling bitmap and color fonts.
