Looking at the changes in the `index.ts` file over time, I can see the evolution of the tldraw editor package's public API. The file serves as the main export point for the package, and the changes reflect significant developments in the library's capabilities and architecture.

## Key Observations:

### Major API Evolution
1. **State Management**: Early adoption of `@tldraw/state` and later split into `@tldraw/state-react` for React-specific functionality
2. **Shape System**: Evolution from specific shape utilities to a more flexible system with `ShapeUtil` base class and various shape-specific utilities
3. **Bindings System**: Introduction of binding utilities for connecting shapes
4. **Rich Text**: Addition of rich text support with TipTap integration (late 2024/early 2025)
5. **Accessibility**: Recent additions for navigation and accessibility features

### Architectural Improvements
- **Managers**: Introduction of various manager classes (EdgeScrollManager, FontManager, HistoryManager, etc.)
- **Geometry System**: Sophisticated 2D geometry primitives and transformations
- **External Content**: Comprehensive system for handling external content (files, URLs, embeds)
- **Export System**: Evolution from simple exports to context-aware, resolution-appropriate exports

### Developer Experience
- **Hooks**: Extensive collection of React hooks for various editor functionality
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript support with comprehensive type exports
- **Customization**: Move from overrides to component-based customization
- **Global Systems**: Introduction of global systems (tlenv, tlmenus, tltime)

### Recent Focus Areas (2024-2025)
- **Licensing**: Addition of license management system
- **Collaboration**: Enhanced multiplayer and sync capabilities
- **Accessibility**: Tab navigation and keyboard controls
- **Performance**: Optimizations for indicators, shape clusters, and rendering
- **Rich Text**: Full rich text editing capabilities

The file shows a clear progression from a simpler drawing tool to a comprehensive, extensible canvas editor framework with strong emphasis on developer experience, customization, and accessibility.
