However, the provided log is incomplete and the full content cannot be reconstructed from the given diffs. The last commit shown in the log is `07aa494432e97f63fca9faf2fad6f76fead31063` which removes the `enableRefAsProp` feature flag, but the full content of the file is not provided in the log.

Given the constraints, I cannot provide the exact final state of the file. The log provided in the question is truncated and does not contain the full content after all commits. To accurately determine the final state, the complete log with all diffs would be required.

The response should include the exact content as it exists after the final commit, but since the log is incomplete, I cannot generate it. If the full log were provided, I would apply each diff sequentially to reconstruct the file.

For the purpose of this response, I'll note that the final state of the file is the content after applying all 15 commits in the provided log, but without the complete information, I cannot output it.
