Here are the key changes made to the Inspector.zig file across these commits:

1. Added display of memory usage in both bytes and KiB for improved readability.

2. Fixed font size display to use "%.2f pt" format string instead of "%d pt".

3. Renamed utils.zig to units.zig and updated imports accordingly.

4. Added keyboard navigation support for the Terminal IO window:
   - Added J/K and arrow key navigation
   - Implemented logic to handle selection and scrolling

5. Updated enum syntax for Zig 0.14 compatibility:
   - Changed `@typeInfo(X).Enum.fields` to `@typeInfo(X).@"enum".fields`
   - Changed `@typeInfo(X).Struct.fields` to `@typeInfo(X).@"struct".fields`

6. Removed some TODO comments related to paged terminal implementation.

7. Updated mouse coordinate handling to use new renderer.Coordinate system.

8. Minor code cleanups and formatting improvements.

These changes improve the inspector's usability, update it for newer Zig syntax, and prepare it for upcoming terminal features like paged scrollback.
