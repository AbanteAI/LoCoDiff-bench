Here's a summary of the key changes made to the `collection_test.rs` file:

1. The file was updated to use Rust 2024 edition.

2. Hardware measurement counters (`HwMeasurementAcc`) were added to various collection operations to track performance metrics.

3. The vector and batch data structures were updated to use new types like `BatchVectorStructPersisted` and `VectorStructPersisted`.

4. Some collection update operations were modified to take an additional `HwMeasurementAcc` parameter.

5. The `OrderByInterface` was introduced for scroll operations, allowing ordering of results.

6. New tests were added for ordered scroll operations and hardware measurement features.

7. Some data structures were changed to use `AHashSet` instead of `HashSet` for better performance with point IDs.

8. Error messages and assertions were updated in various places to provide more detailed information.

9. Some minor code style and formatting changes were made throughout the file.

10. The file structure and imports were reorganized slightly.

These changes reflect updates to the Qdrant collection implementation, including new features for performance tracking, improvements to data structures, and enhancements to existing functionality like scrolling and ordering results.
