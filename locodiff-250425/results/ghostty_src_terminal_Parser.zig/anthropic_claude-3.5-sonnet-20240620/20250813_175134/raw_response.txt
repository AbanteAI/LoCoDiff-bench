Here is a summary of the key changes made to the `src/terminal/Parser.zig` file over time:

1. Initial implementation of a VT-series parser for escape and control sequences, based on the state machine described on vt100.net.

2. Added support for parsing CSI (Control Sequence Introducer) commands, including handling parameters and intermediates.

3. Implemented UTF-8 decoding within the parser.

4. Added support for OSC (Operating System Command) parsing.

5. Improved handling of CSI parameters, including support for both semicolon and colon separators in SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) commands.

6. Added support for DCS (Device Control String) parsing.

7. Implemented APC (Application Program Command) parsing.

8. Increased the maximum number of CSI parameters from 16 to 24 to handle more complex real-world sequences.

9. Various optimizations and bug fixes throughout development.

10. Improved error handling and logging for invalid sequences.

11. Added more comprehensive test cases to cover various edge cases and real-world scenarios.

The parser evolved to handle more complex terminal sequences and edge cases over time, while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing terminal protocols. The changes reflect an ongoing effort to improve compatibility with various terminal emulators and applications.
