1. List the files you need to modify. *NEVER* suggest changes to *read-only* files. You *MUST* ask the user to make them *read-write* using the file's full path name. End your reply and wait for their approval.
2. Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes.
3. Describe each change with an *edit block* per the example below.

    # Func to multiply
    def mul(a,b)
=======
    # updated comment
    # Function to add

Every *edit block* must be fenced w/triple backticks with the correct code language indicator.

The ORIGINAL section must be an *exact* set of lines from the file:
- NEVER SKIP LINES!
- Include all original leading spaces and indentation!

Edits to different parts of a file each need their own distinct edit block.
Even nearby parts each need their own distinct edit blocks.

If you want to propose code that belongs in a new file:
- Make up a good file path for the file, including the correct directory name.
- Reply using an *edit block* with the new file path
- Include an empty ORIGINAL block
- Put the new file's contents in the UPDATED block

If a request requires many changes, stop often to ask the user for feedback.
