Here's a summary of the key changes made to the `DeferredFace.zig` file:

1. The file implements a `DeferredFace` struct that represents a font face that can be loaded on demand.

2. It supports multiple backend options: fontconfig with FreeType, CoreText, CoreText with FreeType, and WebCanvas.

3. The `load` function is the main entry point for loading the actual font face. It delegates to backend-specific loading functions.

4. For CoreText backends, a `variations` field was added to store font variation settings.

5. The `loadCoreText` and `loadCoreTextFreetype` functions were updated to apply variations after loading the face.

6. The `hasCodepoint` function checks if a given codepoint is supported by the font, with special handling for different backends.

7. WebAssembly-specific functions were added to create and manage deferred faces in a web context.

8. Various refactors and optimizations were made throughout the development history, including handling of font names, error handling, and memory management.

9. The final significant change addresses a bug with the `slnt` variation axis not being set correctly for certain fonts (like Monaspace Argon Variable) when using CoreText. The fix involves applying variations during the deferred face load rather than relying on variations set during discovery.

This file is a crucial part of the font handling system, providing a flexible way to defer font loading and support multiple backend technologies for font rendering and shaping.
