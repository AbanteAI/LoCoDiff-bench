```

This represents a text shaper implementation using Harfbuzz that:

1. Manages text shaping features via Harfbuzz font features
2. Forces LTR text direction for consistent rendering 
3. Handles text runs with cell offsets and advances
4. Supports font fallbacks and special case fonts
5. Integrates with the terminal's screen buffer and selection model
6. Provides thread-safe access to font resources

The code has evolved through several major changes including:

- Moving from static cell buffers to dynamic allocation
- Adding support for font features and variants 
- Improving RTL text handling
- Refining how ligatures and background colors are handled
- Updating to work with a new font collection API
- Fixing various edge cases around emoji and combining characters

The shaper is a key part of the terminal's text rendering pipeline, handling the complex task of converting Unicode text into positioned glyphs while respecting font features and maintaining compatibility with terminal cell-based rendering.
