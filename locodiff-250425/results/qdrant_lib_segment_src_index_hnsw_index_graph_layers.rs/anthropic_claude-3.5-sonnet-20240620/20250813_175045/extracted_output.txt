Here are the key changes made to the `graph_layers.rs` file:

1. The `GraphLayers` struct now has a single `links` field of type `GraphLinks` instead of being generic over a `TGraphLinks` type parameter.

2. The `search_on_level` and `_search_on_level` methods now take an additional `is_stopped: &AtomicBool` parameter and return a `CancellableResult` instead of directly returning the result.

3. The `search` method also takes an `is_stopped` parameter and returns a `CancellableResult`.

4. The `prefault_mmap_pages` method was replaced with a `populate` method that returns an `OperationResult`.

5. The `compress_ram` method was added for testing purposes to compress the graph links in RAM.

6. The `load` method now takes a `compress` boolean parameter to optionally compress the links when loading.

7. Some utility methods like `get_path`, `get_links_path`, and `files` were added to manage file paths.

8. The test code was updated to work with the new `CancellableResult` return types and to test both compressed and uncompressed graph formats.

9. The `GraphLinksConverter` was renamed to `GraphLinksSerializer`.

These changes mainly focus on making the graph operations cancellable, supporting both in-memory and on-disk storage, and allowing for compressed link storage. The structure was also simplified by removing the generic type parameter and using a single `GraphLinks` enum instead.
