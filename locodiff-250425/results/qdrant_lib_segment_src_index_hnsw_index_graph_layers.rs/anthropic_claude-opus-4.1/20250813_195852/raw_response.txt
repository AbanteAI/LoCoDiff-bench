Looking at this file's commit history, I can provide a comprehensive analysis of `graph_layers.rs`:

## Overview

This is a core component of the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index implementation in Qdrant. The file manages the multi-layered graph structure used for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search.

## Key Components

### 1. **Main Struct: `GraphLayers`**
```rust
pub struct GraphLayers {
    pub(super) m: usize,        // Max connections for non-zero layers
    pub(super) m0: usize,       // Max connections for layer 0
    pub(super) links: GraphLinks,  // The actual graph connections
    pub(super) entry_points: EntryPoints,  // Entry points for search
    pub(super) visited_pool: VisitedPool,  // Object pool for visited tracking
}
```

### 2. **Core Functionality**

#### Graph Construction
- **Random layer assignment**: Points are assigned to layers based on exponential decay probability
- **Link management**: Manages bidirectional links between points in the graph
- **Heuristic selection**: Originally supported both with/without heuristic for neighbor selection

#### Search Algorithm
- **Multi-level search**: Starts from higher layers and descends to layer 0
- **Greedy search**: Uses greedy best-first search at each layer
- **Visited tracking**: Efficiently tracks visited nodes using a pool-based system

## Evolution Through Commits

### Early Development (2021)
- **Initial implementation**: Basic HNSW structure with filterable search capabilities
- **Performance optimizations**: 
  - Lock-free visited pool
  - SeaHash for faster hashing
  - Build time optimizations

### Architecture Changes (2022-2023)
- **Removed dynamic metrics**: Shifted from runtime polymorphism to compile-time generics
- **Memory management improvements**:
  - Added mmap support for disk-based storage
  - Implemented chunked vector storage
  - Added deletion flags support

### Compression & Optimization (2024-2025)
- **Graph compression**: Added bitpacking for link compression
- **GPU support**: Added GPU-accelerated HNSW construction
- **Separated storage formats**: Plain vs compressed links stored in different files
- **Cancellation support**: Added `is_stopped` checks for graceful cancellation

## Current Architecture

### Storage Format
```
graph.bin                 # Graph metadata (m, m0, entry points)
links.bin                 # Plain link storage
links_compressed.bin      # Compressed link storage
```

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Trait-based abstraction**: `GraphLayersBase` trait for core operations
2. **Visitor pattern**: Used for link iteration
3. **Builder pattern**: Graph construction through builders
4. **Resource pooling**: Visited list pooling to reduce allocations

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Memory efficiency**:
   - Compressed link storage using bitpacking
   - Memory-mapped files for large graphs
   - Chunked storage to avoid large contiguous allocations

2. **Search optimizations**:
   - Early termination when candidates fall below threshold
   - Efficient visited tracking with bit arrays
   - Custom priority queues with fixed capacity

3. **Parallel construction**:
   - Support for parallel graph building
   - GPU acceleration for construction

## Technical Debt & Issues Addressed

1. **Backward compatibility**: Handled migration from older formats (pre-0.8.5)
2. **Deletion handling**: Added proper support for deleted vectors
3. **Quantization support**: Integrated with quantized vector storage
4. **Custom entry points**: Added support for search with custom starting points

## Current State (2025)

The implementation is mature and optimized, featuring:
- Efficient compressed storage
- GPU acceleration support
- Robust cancellation handling
- Multiple storage backends (RAM/mmap)
- Comprehensive test coverage

The code shows a clear evolution from a basic HNSW implementation to a production-ready, highly optimized system suitable for large-scale vector search operations.
