    media: allow canvas-sourced images to have different scale levels. (@tldraw/assets) (#5840)
    
    The goal of this PR is to allow images that came from the canvas/are
    part of tldr files to have different scale levels, in the same way that
    external ones can.
    
    Right now, our mechanism for getting assets for something in an exported
    SVG is:
    - try to resolve the asset via the blob store (i.e. with the canvas-src)
    - if that doesn't work, try to resolve via whatever external asset url
    store we have in the editor (i.e. by default, whatever URLs we got when
    importing the asset)
    
    This works fine, but has the implication that we always use the same
    URLs when exporting a .tldr image, whether its in an SVG, or a bitmap,
    etc, leading to a not-great user experience when e.g. exporting to a
    small bitmap - we'd potentially just server the same massive original
    file at the much smaller size.
    
    To handle this, we need to get the original blob out of the blob store
    when one is available, resample it, and serve that. Unfortunately, this
    needs to be done in a few different places in our export code, since we
    originally skip the blob store when exporting SVGs (since they can't
    contain blob URLs as-is)
    
    ### Change type
    
    - [x] `improvement`
    
    ### Release notes
    
    - Images that are embedded in files will now scale appropriately when
    included in exports.

    media: correctly animate canvas assets in LOD (#5842)
    
    the previous PR missed a bunch of the logic for loading animated assets,
    meaning we weren't animating in-app assets. this fixes that.
    
    ### Change type
    
    - [x] `bugfix`
    
    ### Release notes
    
    - Fixed a bug where some images would stop animating
