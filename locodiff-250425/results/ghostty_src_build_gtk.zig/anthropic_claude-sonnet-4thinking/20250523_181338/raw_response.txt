Looking at the git log, I can see the evolution of the `src/build/gtk.zig` file through three commits:

1. Initial creation with `x11` and `wayland` targets
2. Addition of `layer_shell` support  
3. Removal of `layer_shell` functionality

The final state after the last commit removes the `layer_shell` field and related detection logic, leaving only the `x11` and `wayland` target detection.

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub const Targets = packed struct {
    x11: bool = false,
    wayland: bool = false,
};

/// Returns the targets that GTK4 was compiled with.
pub fn targets(b: *std.Build) Targets {
    // Run pkg-config. We allow it to fail so that zig build --help
    // works without all dependencies. The build will fail later when
    // GTK isn't found anyways.
    var code: u8 = undefined;
    const output = b.runAllowFail(
        &.{ "pkg-config", "--variable=targets", "gtk4" },
        &code,
        .Ignore,
    ) catch return .{};

    const x11 = std.mem.indexOf(u8, output, "x11") != null;
    const wayland = std.mem.indexOf(u8, output, "wayland") != null;

    return .{
        .x11 = x11,
        .wayland = wayland,
    };
}
```
