The file `src/build/gtk.zig` has evolved through three commits. The initial version defined a `Targets` struct with `x11` and `wayland` fields. The second commit added a `layer_shell` field and corresponding logic to detect it. The final commit removed the `layer_shell` field and its detection logic, reverting the struct to its original two fields while keeping the intermediate variable assignments introduced in the second commit.

Here is the exact state of the file after the final commit:

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub const Targets = packed struct {
    x11: bool = false,
    wayland: bool = false,
};

/// Returns the targets that GTK4 was compiled with.
pub fn targets(b: *std.Build) Targets {
    // Run pkg-config. We allow it to fail so that zig build --help
    // works without all dependencies. The build will fail later when
    // GTK isn't found anyways.
    var code: u8 = undefined;
    const output = b.runAllowFail(
        &.{ "pkg-config", "--variable=targets", "gtk4" },
        &code,
        .Ignore,
    ) catch return .{};

    const x11 = std.mem.indexOf(u8, output, "x11") != null;
    const wayland = std.mem.indexOf(u8, output, "wayland") != null;

    return .{
        .x11 = x11,
        .wayland = wayland,
    };
}
```
