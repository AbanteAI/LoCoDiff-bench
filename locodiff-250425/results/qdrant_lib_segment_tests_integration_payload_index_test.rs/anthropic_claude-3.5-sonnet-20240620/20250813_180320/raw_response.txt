Here are the key changes made to the `payload_index_test.rs` file across these commits:

1. The `TestSegments` struct was introduced to encapsulate test segments.

2. A `validate_geo_filter` helper function was added to reduce code duplication.

3. The `test_read_operations` test was added to run multiple tests on the same `TestSegments` instance.

4. Many individual tests were converted into functions that take a `&TestSegments` parameter.

5. Error handling was improved by using `anyhow::Result` and the `ensure!` macro.

6. The `HardwareCounterCell` was introduced and passed to various operations to measure I/O.

7. Cardinality estimation now takes a `HardwareCounterCell` parameter.

8. `create_field_index` calls now take an additional `HardwareCounterCell` parameter.

9. The `build` method on `SegmentBuilder` now takes a `HardwareCounterCell` parameter.

10. `set_indexed` calls on the index now take a `HardwareCounterCell` parameter.

11. Some assertions were replaced with `ensure!` calls for better error reporting.

12. The Rust edition was updated to 2024, resulting in some minor syntax changes.

13. The test code was refactored to use more idiomatic Rust patterns and improve readability.

These changes generally focus on improving test infrastructure, adding I/O measurement capabilities, and refactoring for better code organization and error handling. The core functionality being tested remains largely the same, but the tests are now more robust and provide more detailed performance information.
