Here's a summary of the key changes to the `src/config.zig` file over time:

1. The file initially exported the `Config` struct and various enums/types used in the configuration.

2. Additional configuration types and options were gradually added, such as:
   - `CopyOnSelect`, `MouseShiftCapture`, `NonNativeFullscreen`, `OptionAsAlt`
   - `ShellIntegrationFeatures`, `ClipboardAccess`, `FontSyntheticStyle`
   - `WindowPaddingColor`, `FreetypeLoadFlags`

3. Support for repeatable configuration options was added:
   - `RepeatableString`, `RepeatablePath`, `RepeatableCodepointMap`, `RepeatableFontVariation`

4. Conditional configuration system was introduced with `conditional` and `ConditionalState`.

5. File formatting utilities were added (`FileFormatter`, `entryFormatter`, `formatEntry`).

6. C and WebAssembly APIs were added for interoperability (`CAPI` and `Wasm`).

7. Support for environment variables in the configuration was added with `RepeatableStringMap`.

8. The `Command` type was introduced to allow specifying whether commands should be shell-expanded or not.

9. Various smaller improvements were made, such as optimizing allocations and adding unit tests.

The file evolved to support a more complex and flexible configuration system, with features like conditional configs, repeatable options, and fine-grained control over command execution. It also expanded to support multiple platforms and integration methods.
