Here's a summary of the changes made to the `strip_filename` function in the `editblock_coder.py` file:

1. For filenames starting with the fence characters:
   - If the remaining part of the filename contains a dot (.) or a forward slash (/), it's considered a valid filename and returned.
   - Otherwise, the function returns None, indicating no valid filename was found.

2. For filenames starting with triple backticks:
   - The same logic as above is applied.
   - If a valid filename is found after removing the triple backticks, it's returned.
   - Otherwise, the function returns None.

3. If the filename doesn't start with fence characters or triple backticks, the original stripping logic is applied (removing colons, hashtags, etc.).

These changes improve the handling of filenames that might start with fence characters or triple backticks, while still maintaining the ability to detect and strip away common markup artifacts from filenames.
