Here are the key changes made to the GeoShapeUtil class in this file:

1. The `getGeometry` method was updated to create different Geometry2d objects based on the shape type. It now uses Polygon2d, Ellipse2d, Stadium2d etc. instead of just returning vertices.

2. A `getHandleSnapGeometry` method was added to provide custom snap points for different geo shapes.

3. The `component` method was updated to use RichTextLabel instead of TextLabel, and to handle rich text content.

4. The `getText` method now renders plaintext from rich text.

5. A `getFontFaces` method was added to get fonts from rich text.

6. The `toSvg` method was updated to use RichTextSVG for text rendering.

7. The `onResize`, `onBeforeCreate`, and `onBeforeUpdate` methods were updated to handle rich text and scaled dimensions.

8. A `getInterpolatedProps` method was added for animation interpolation.

9. The `getUnscaledLabelSize` helper function was updated to measure HTML rendered from rich text.

10. Various performance optimizations were made, like using `isEmptyRichText` checks instead of rendering plaintext.

11. The component now uses `useIsReadyForEditing` to determine when to show the HTML container for text editing.

Overall, the changes primarily relate to supporting rich text, improving performance, and refining the geometry and snap point handling for different geo shapes.
