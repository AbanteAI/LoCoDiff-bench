Looking at this file, I can see the evolution of the GeoShapeUtil component over time. Here are the main patterns and changes I observed:

## Key Changes and Patterns

### 1. **Text System Evolution (Multiple major changes)**
- Started with simple `text` property
- Transitioned to rich text system using TipTap
- Multiple performance optimizations for text rendering
- Added weak caching for text operations
- Introduced `isEmptyRichText` checks to avoid expensive text parsing

### 2. **Dynamic Scaling Feature**
- Added `scale` property to support dynamic size mode
- Shapes can now maintain consistent visual size across zoom levels
- Required significant refactoring of size calculations

### 3. **Performance Optimizations**
- Text editor mounting optimization (only mount when needed)
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Reduced DOM node count for empty shapes
- Improved indicator visibility logic

### 4. **Geometry System Improvements**
- Transitioned from manual SVG construction to React components
- Added `Geometry2d` system with better abstraction
- Improved hit testing and intersection logic
- Added support for transformations and filters

### 5. **New Shape Types**
- Added heart shape to the geo shape set
- Each shape type has specific geometry calculations

### 6. **Code Organization**
- Moved from function properties to methods
- Better separation of concerns (geometry, rendering, text)
- Extracted common functionality to helper files

## Technical Debt and Refactoring Patterns

1. **Text System Complexity**: The migration from plain text to rich text introduced significant complexity, with multiple helper functions and performance considerations.

2. **Backwards Compatibility**: Several migrations to handle older shape data formats.

3. **Performance-driven Design**: Many changes focused on reducing render cycles and improving performance for large projects.

4. **Abstraction Layers**: Progressive addition of abstraction layers (Geometry2d, transformed geometries) to simplify complex calculations.

The file shows a clear evolution from a simpler implementation to a more sophisticated system that handles rich text, dynamic scaling, and performance at scale while maintaining backwards compatibility.
