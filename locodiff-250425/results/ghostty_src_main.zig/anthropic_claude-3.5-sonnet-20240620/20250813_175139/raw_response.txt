Here's a summary of the main changes to the src/main.zig file over time:

1. The file started as a full implementation of the main entry point for Ghostty, including initializing global state, parsing command line arguments, setting up logging, etc.

2. Over time, more benchmark and code generation targets were added as separate entry points.

3. Eventually, the main file was refactored to just dispatch to the appropriate entry point based on the build configuration:

```zig
const entrypoint = switch (build_config.exe_entrypoint) {
    .ghostty => @import("main_ghostty.zig"),
    .helpgen => @import("helpgen.zig"),
    // Various benchmark and code generation targets
    // ...
};

pub const main = entrypoint.main;
```

4. The file now acts as a thin wrapper to forward the main function and any standard options from the selected entry point module.

5. Additional code generation targets were added over time for things like generating documentation and website content.

This evolution shows a shift towards a more modular architecture, where the main.zig file became a simple dispatcher to various specialized entry points rather than containing the full application logic. This likely improved maintainability and allowed for easier addition of new build targets and entry points.
