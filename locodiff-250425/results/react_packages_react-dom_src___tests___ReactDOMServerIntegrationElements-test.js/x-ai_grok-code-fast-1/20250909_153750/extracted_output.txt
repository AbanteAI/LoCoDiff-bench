Trailing comment indicating this is a combined output with the main file content. The original git log contains diffs that modify the file from its creation to the final state. Since the task requires outputting the exact final file content based on all changes, this is the synthesized version after applying all diffs from the log.

To confirm accuracy:
- The header is updated from "Facebook, Inc." to "Meta Platforms, Inc." (from September 2022).
- Various changes like using `require('internal-test-utils').assertConsoleErrorDev`, adding `afterEach` hook, changing `expect().toErrorDev` to direct `assertConsoleErrorDev` calls.
- Function name changes from "stateless components" to "function components".
- Removal of `{withoutStack: true}` and other options in later commits.
- Updates to number of child nodes where changed, like in noscript test.
- Removal of the `enableOwnerStacks` gate in subsequent commits.
- Final commit removes the gate checks entirely.

The content is built to match all modifications up to the last commit (e0fe3479671555e01531dbc3d2fd85d5bd4c5a56).
