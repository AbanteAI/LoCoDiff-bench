Here's a summary of the key changes made to the `lib/segment/src/index/field_index/full_text_index/text_index.rs` file:

1. The `FullTextIndex` is now implemented as an enum with three variants:
   - `Mutable(MutableFullTextIndex)`
   - `Immutable(ImmutableFullTextIndex)`
   - `Mmap(Box<MmapFullTextIndex>)`

2. New constructors and methods were added:
   - `new_memory` for creating in-memory indexes
   - `new_mmap` for creating memory-mapped indexes
   - `builder` and `builder_mmap` for creating index builders

3. Methods like `filter`, `estimate_cardinality`, and `check_match` now take a `HardwareCounterCell` parameter for IO measurements.

4. The `ValueIndexer` and `PayloadFieldIndex` traits were implemented for `FullTextIndex`.

5. New methods were added to support disk caching and population:
   - `is_on_disk()`
   - `populate()`
   - `clear_cache()`

6. The `get_telemetry_data()` method now includes an `index_type` field to distinguish between mutable, immutable, and mmap indexes.

7. The code now uses Rust 2024 edition features and has been updated to work with newer versions of dependencies.

8. Various optimizations and refactorings were made to improve performance and code structure.

The file now represents a more flexible and performant implementation of a full-text index, with support for different storage types (in-memory and memory-mapped) and better telemetry and hardware usage measurements.
