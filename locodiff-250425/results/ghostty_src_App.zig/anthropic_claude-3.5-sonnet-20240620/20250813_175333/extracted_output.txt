Here's a summary of the key changes to the `App` struct in the `src/App.zig` file:

1. The struct now contains:
   - A `surfaces` list of active surfaces
   - A `mailbox` for receiving messages
   - A `font_grid_set` for shared font caches
   - A `config_conditional_state` for theme-aware configurations
   - A `first` boolean to track if it's the first surface
   - Fields for rate-limiting notifications

2. The `create` function initializes the App struct and its components.

3. The `tick` function processes closing surfaces and drains the mailbox.

4. `updateConfig` applies new configurations to surfaces and notifies the runtime.

5. `addSurface` and `deleteSurface` manage the list of active surfaces.

6. `keyEvent` handles global keybindings and app-scoped actions.

7. `colorSchemeEvent` updates the app's theme and reloads config if needed.

8. `performAction` executes app-scoped actions like quitting, opening config, etc.

9. The struct no longer has a `quit` flag. Quitting is now handled via actions.

10. Various helper functions like `focusEvent`, `closeSurface`, `newWindow`, etc.

11. A `Message` enum for different types of messages the app can receive.

12. The `Mailbox` type for inter-thread communication.

The App struct serves as the central coordinator for the application, managing surfaces, configurations, and handling global events and actions.
