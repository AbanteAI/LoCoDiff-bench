Looking at the commit history for `segment_builder.rs`, I can see this file has evolved significantly through the Qdrant project's development. Here are the key patterns and notable changes:

## Major Evolution Patterns

### 1. **Initial Creation to Production-Ready Code (March 2021 - March 2022)**
- Started as a simple structure for constructing segments from other segments
- Early focus on version management and basic optimization logic
- Gradual addition of error handling and indexing capabilities

### 2. **Feature Expansion Era (2022-2023)**
- **Named vectors support** - Multiple vectors per point
- **Quantization integration** - Product quantization for memory efficiency
- **Sparse vectors** - Support for high-dimensional sparse data
- **Full-text search** - Text indexing capabilities
- **Payload field types** - UUID, datetime, boolean indices

### 3. **Performance Optimizations (2023-2024)**
- **CPU budget management** - Dynamic resource allocation
- **GPU support** - HNSW index building on GPU
- **Defragmentation** - Optimize data layout for better cache locality
- **Memory efficiency** - Immutable ID tracker, compressed mappings

### 4. **Storage Improvements (2024-2025)**
- **On-disk payload storage** - Mmap-based storage options
- **Cache management** - Explicit cache control for disk-based components
- **ID tracker evolution** - From RocksDB to custom mutable implementation

## Key Technical Improvements

### Resource Management
- Evolution from simple execution to sophisticated CPU/IO permit system
- GPU device locking for accelerated index building
- Cache eviction after optimization to prevent pollution

### Data Organization
- Defragmentation based on payload keys for better query performance
- Sophisticated point merging logic handling versions and deletions
- Optimized internal ID allocation and mapping

### Error Handling
- From basic errors to detailed operation tracking
- Hardware counter integration for IO measurement
- Proper cleanup with TempDir for cancelled operations

### Architecture Changes
- Separation of storage, indexing, and payload components
- Move from monolithic segment building to modular approach
- Support for multiple storage backends (in-memory, mmap, etc.)

## Notable Technical Decisions

1. **Temporary Directory Management**: Uses `TempDir` for atomic segment creation with automatic cleanup on failure

2. **Version Control**: Sophisticated version tracking per point for distributed consistency

3. **Lazy Index Building**: Indexes are built only during optimization, not during regular updates

4. **Cache-Aware Design**: Explicit cache management for on-disk components to prevent cache pollution

5. **Incremental Building**: Support for incremental HNSW index building in append-only scenarios

The file has grown from ~100 lines to ~700+ lines, reflecting the complexity of modern vector database requirements while maintaining clean separation of concerns and robust error handling.
