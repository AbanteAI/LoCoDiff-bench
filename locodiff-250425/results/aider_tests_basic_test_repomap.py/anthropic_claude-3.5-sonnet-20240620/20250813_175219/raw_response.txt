The changes in this commit add support for the Scala programming language to the repository mapping functionality. Here's a summary of the modifications:

1. A new test method `test_language_scala()` is added to the `TestRepoMapAllLanguages` class.

2. The new test method calls the `_test_language_repo_map()` helper method with the following parameters:
   - Language: "scala"
   - File extension: "scala"
   - Key symbol to check: "Greeter"

3. This addition implies that a new Scala fixture file has been created in the `fixtures/languages/scala` directory, likely named `test.scala`, which contains a `Greeter` class or object.

4. The commit message indicates that this change resolves issue #3578, which was presumably a request or bug report related to adding Scala support.

These changes allow the test suite to verify that the repository mapping functionality correctly handles Scala files and can identify key symbols within them. This is part of ensuring that the codebase can work with a wide variety of programming languages.
