Here are the key changes made in this commit:

1. The color space for non-color glyphs was changed from DeviceGray to LinearGray.

2. The color space for color glyphs was changed from DeviceRGB to DisplayP3.

3. For non-color glyphs, the context options were simplified to just use ImageAlphaInfo.only instead of combining it with BitmapInfo.alpha_mask.

4. The commit message indicates that alpha blending is now always done in the Display P3 color space.

5. A new config option `text-blending` was added to allow configuring linear blending (gamma correction).

6. An experimental option was added to correct issues with linear blending making dark text look too thin and bright text look too thick.

7. The changes affect how colors are handled for images and custom shaders as well.

The main goals seem to be:

- Improving color accuracy by using wider color spaces (Display P3)
- Allowing more control over text rendering with linear blending options
- Standardizing on Display P3 for alpha blending across different types of content

This change appears to be part of a larger effort to improve color handling and text rendering quality in the application.
