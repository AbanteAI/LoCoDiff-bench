I'll trace through the history of `ReactCompositeComponent-test.js` to track how string refs were tested and evolved in this file.

## Summary of String Refs in ReactCompositeComponent-test.js

Looking at the commit history, here's how string refs were used and evolved in this test file:

### Initial String Ref Usage (2017)

In the initial commit (d9c1dbd61772f8f8ab0cdf389e70463d704c480b), the test file used string refs extensively:

```javascript
// MorphingComponent used string refs
render() {
  return !this.state.activated
    ? <a ref="x" onClick={toggleActivatedState} />
    : <b ref="x" onClick={toggleActivatedState} />;
}

// ChildUpdates used string refs
getAnchor = () => {
  return this.refs.anch;
};

render() {
  return this.props.renderAnchor
    ? <a ref="anch" className={className} />
    : <b />;
}
```

The tests verified behavior like:
- `expect(instance.refs.x.tagName).toBe('A');`
- `expect(instance.getAnchor().className).toBe('');`

### Transition to createRef (2022)

In commit 6fb8133ed3aa6b23063375dd345c6e413b05f0fe (November 2022), string refs were replaced with `React.createRef()`:

```javascript
// MorphingComponent now uses createRef
xRef = React.createRef();

render() {
  return !this.state.activated
    ? <a ref={this.xRef} onClick={toggleActivatedState} />
    : <b ref={this.xRef} onClick={toggleActivatedState} />;
}

// ChildUpdates also switched to createRef
anchorRef = React.createRef();

getAnchor = () => {
  return this.anchorRef.current;
};
```

The tests were updated accordingly:
- `expect(instance.xRef.current.tagName).toBe('A');`
- `expect(instance.getAnchor().className).toBe('');`

This change was made when "Turn on string ref deprecation warning for everybody" was implemented.

### Key Test Scenarios

The tests covered important string ref behaviors:
1. **Ref rewiring**: When component types change (e.g., `<a>` to `<b>`)
2. **DOM node caching**: Ensuring old nodes aren't cached when constructors switch
3. **Component unmounting**: Proper cleanup of refs

### Other String Ref Related Changes

- The test file also dealt with `ReactCurrentOwner` which was related to how React tracked the owner component for string refs
- Later commits (2024) show the removal of string ref related infrastructure, with cleanup of `ReactCurrentOwner` and movement to async dispatchers

The evolution shows React's gradual deprecation of string refs in favor of the callback ref pattern and createRef API, maintaining backwards compatibility while encouraging migration to newer patterns.
