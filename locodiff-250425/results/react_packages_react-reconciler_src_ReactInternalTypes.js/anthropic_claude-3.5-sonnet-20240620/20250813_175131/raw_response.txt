Here are the key changes made to the ReactInternalTypes.js file in this commit:

1. Added `ActivityInstance` to the imports from './ReactFiberConfig':

```javascript
import type {
  // ...existing imports
  ActivityInstance,
  // ...
} from './ReactFiberConfig';
```

2. Updated the `SuspenseHydrationCallbacks` type to include `ActivityInstance`:

```javascript
export type SuspenseHydrationCallbacks = {
  +onHydrated?: (
    hydrationBoundary: SuspenseInstance | ActivityInstance,
  ) => void,
  +onDeleted?: (hydrationBoundary: SuspenseInstance | ActivityInstance) => void,
  ...
};
```

These changes add support for `ActivityInstance` in the hydration callbacks, allowing them to handle both Suspense and Activity instances during the hydration process. The `+` before the property names indicates that these properties are read-only.

The commit message mentions that this implements equivalent configs for ActivityInstance as exist for SuspenseInstance, allowing for different implementations in renderers while maintaining a consistent interface.
