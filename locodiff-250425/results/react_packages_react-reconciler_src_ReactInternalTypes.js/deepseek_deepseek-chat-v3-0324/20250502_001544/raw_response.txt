    Implement offscreen pending state for Activity to prevent prerendering  while offscreen (#32889)
    
    Stacked on #32888.
    
    This implements the equivalent to `pendingSuspenseBoundaries` for
    Activities and Activity Suspense boundaries. It prevents prerendering
    while there's still a pending Activity offscreen.

    Move setBubbleProperties from Tracing Markers to Activity (#32892)
    
    We should move the bubble properties from Tracing Marker to Activity. We
    shouldn't be supporting this on TracingMarker (it's also already off for
    www).
    
    The bubble properties currently on TransitionTracing is used by Activity
    now so it should probably move there.
    
    In the future, we'll likely add this as a feature of rendering primitive
    types that has nothing to do with tracing or offscreen. E.g. for certain
    special cases like `<html>`, `<body>` and `<dialog>`. That'll be a
    separate type of renderer primitive.
