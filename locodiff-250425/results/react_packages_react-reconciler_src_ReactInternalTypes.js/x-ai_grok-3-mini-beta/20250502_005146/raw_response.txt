Assistant: First, the user has provided a git log for the file `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactInternalTypes.js`. My task is to output the exact state of this file as it exists after the final commit in the log.

The log is in reverse chronological order due to `--reverse`, so the first commit listed is the oldest, and the last one is the most recent.

To get the final state, I need to start with the content from the initial commit and apply all the subsequent diffs in sequence.

From the log:

1. **Initial Commit (376d5c1b5aa17724c5fea9412f8fcde14a7b23f1)**: This creates the file with a large block of code defining types like Fiber, Dependencies, etc.

2. Subsequent commits modify this file by adding, removing, or altering lines.

The final commit is e136484, but wait, the provided text ends with e61fd91f5c523adb63a3b97375ac95ac657dc07f, which is actually the last one in the sequence.

The response must wrap the entire file content in triple backticks and end after that.

The final content is the JavaScript code after all patches. From the history, the last version is the one after applying all diffs to the initial code.

Since the initial code is provided in the first diff, and each subsequent diff modifies it, the aggregated code is what I need to output.

The final version, based on the diffs, is the complete TypeScript (or Flow) file with all changes applied, ending with the code from theSequence of commits.

Output the full code block as it would look after the last commit. For example, the initial code is:

```javascript
// [Content from first commit]
```

With modifications up to the last one.

The AI's response should be exactly that full code, wrapped in triple backticks.```javascript
