Looking at the git history of the `packages/editor/src/lib/components/Shape.tsx` file, I can identify several major optimization patterns that have been implemented:

## Key Optimization Patterns

### 1. **Memoization and Preventing Unnecessary Re-renders**
- The component uses `React.memo` to prevent re-renders when shape props/meta haven't changed
- InnerShape and InnerShapeBackground are memoized separately, only re-rendering when shape.props or shape.meta change

### 2. **Style Update Batching**
- Introduced `memoizedStuffRef` to track previous values and only update DOM styles when values actually change
- This prevents unnecessary DOM manipulations:
```typescript
const memoizedStuffRef = useRef({
  transform: '',
  clipPath: 'none',
  width: 0,
  height: 0,
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
  isCulled: false,
})
```

### 3. **Culling Optimization**
- Shapes outside the viewport are culled using `display: none` instead of rendering a simplified version
- Culled shapes skip rendering of child components entirely
- Background shapes are also culled when the main shape is culled

### 4. **DOM Property Updates**
- Direct DOM manipulation using `setStyleProperty` instead of React re-renders for frequently changing properties
- Properties like transform, width, height, opacity are updated directly on the DOM

### 5. **Reactive Updates with useQuickReactor**
- Uses `useQuickReactor` from @tldraw/state to batch and optimize reactive updates
- Separates concerns - different reactors for different types of updates (transform, culling, etc.)

### 6. **Font Loading Optimization**
- Font loading is handled separately using a react effect
- Fonts are requested based on shape ID to avoid redundant requests

### 7. **Fresh Data Without Re-renders**
- Uses `store.unsafeGetWithoutCapture` to get fresh shape data without triggering re-renders
- This ensures the shape util always gets the latest data while maintaining memoization benefits

### 8. **Separation of Background and Foreground**
- Background components are rendered separately and can be culled independently
- This allows for more granular optimization of shape rendering

### 9. **Layout Effects for Infrequent Updates**
- Uses `useLayoutEffect` for properties that change infrequently (opacity, z-index)
- This reduces the overhead of reactive tracking for these properties

These optimizations work together to minimize re-renders, reduce DOM manipulations, and efficiently handle large numbers of shapes on the canvas.
