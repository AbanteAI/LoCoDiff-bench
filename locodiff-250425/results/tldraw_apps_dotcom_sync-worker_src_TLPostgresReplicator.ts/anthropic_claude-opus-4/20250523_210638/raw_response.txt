## Summary of TLPostgresReplicator

The `TLPostgresReplicator` is a Cloudflare Durable Object that handles real-time replication of PostgreSQL database changes to connected users. Here's what it does:

### Key Features

1. **Real-time Database Replication**:
   - Uses PostgreSQL's logical replication (WAL) to subscribe to database changes
   - Tracks changes to `user`, `file`, and `file_state` tables
   - Maintains a persistent replication slot for reliable change tracking

2. **Event Distribution System**:
   - Distributes database changes to active users via User Durable Objects
   - Maintains active user tracking and file subscriptions
   - Ensures in-order message delivery using per-user execution queues

3. **History Management**:
   - Keeps a history of recent database changes (up to 20,000 rows)
   - Allows users to resume from a known point without full database refresh
   - Prunes inactive users after 10 minutes of inactivity

4. **State Management**:
   - Uses SQLite for local state storage
   - Tracks LSN (Log Sequence Number) for replication position
   - Handles reconnection and recovery from connection failures

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Batches changes by transaction before sending to users
   - Implements heartbeat mechanism to keep connections alive
   - Supports lazy loading - only tracks data for active users

### Architecture Flow

1. **Connection**: Establishes connection to PostgreSQL using pg-logical-replication
2. **Subscription**: Creates/resumes from a persistent replication slot
3. **Event Processing**: Receives WAL events and parses them into structured changes
4. **Distribution**: Routes changes to relevant User Durable Objects
5. **History**: Maintains change history for resume capability
6. **Pruning**: Periodically removes inactive users and old history

The replicator serves as a critical bridge between the PostgreSQL database and the real-time collaboration features, ensuring users see consistent, up-to-date data while minimizing database load through efficient change tracking and distribution.
