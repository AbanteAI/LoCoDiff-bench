 //! This file contains all the terminal modes that we support

-//! a packed struct to store mode values, a more generalized state
-//! struct to store values plus handle save/restore, and much more.

-//! There is pretty heavy comptime usage and type generation here.
-//! I don't love to have this sort of complexity but its a good way
