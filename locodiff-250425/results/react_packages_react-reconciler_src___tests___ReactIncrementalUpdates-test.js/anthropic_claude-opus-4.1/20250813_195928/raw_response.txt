Looking at the git history of `ReactIncrementalUpdates-test.js`, I can trace the evolution of the test that demonstrates render phase updates:

## Key Commits

1. **Original implementation (October 2017)** - The test was introduced to verify that calling `setState` inside an updater function would emit a warning, demonstrating that React treats such updates specially.

2. **Production mode testing (November 2017)** - The test was updated to properly check for the warning only in development mode.

3. **Lanes implementation (April-May 2020)** - The test behavior was updated when React transitioned from the expiration time model to the lanes model. The test showed different behavior based on the `deferRenderPhaseUpdateToNextBatch` flag.

4. **Feature flag cleanup (March 2021)** - The `deferRenderPhaseUpdateToNextBatch` flag was removed, standardizing the behavior where render phase updates flush immediately in the same render.

## Current Test Behavior

The test now demonstrates that:
1. When `setState` is called inside a setState updater function
2. The update is processed immediately in the same render (not deferred)
3. A development warning is emitted about side effects in updater functions
4. The warning is deduplicated on subsequent violations

## Key Code Section

```javascript
instance.setState(function a() {
  Scheduler.log('setState updater');
  this.setState({b: 'b'});  // This setState happens during render phase
  return {a: 'a'};
});

await waitForAll([
  'setState updater',
  // The update flushes immediately in the same render
  'render',
]);
```

The test confirms that render phase updates (updates triggered while React is already rendering) are handled synchronously within the current render, which is the current intended behavior in React's reconciler.
