This commit makes changes to how passive effects are scheduled and executed in React's Fiber reconciler. Here are the key points:

1. Passive effects are now treated similarly to other work on the root, using the regular `ensureRootIsScheduled` flow.

2. The commit introduces a new flag `enableYieldingBeforePassive` that changes the behavior of when passive effects are executed.

3. With the new behavior (when `enableYieldingBeforePassive` is true):
   - Passive effects are now part of the continuation of work rather than a separate callback.
   - They may be executed earlier or later than before, depending on the priority of other work.
   - For Idle priority work, passive effects may be executed later if there's other non-React work.
   - For Default priority work, passive effects may be executed earlier if there's other Default priority work.

4. The changes aim to make the scheduling of passive effects more consistent with other types of work in React.

5. The test case is updated to account for this new behavior:
   - If `enableYieldingBeforePassive` is true, the effect is now expected to be executed immediately after rendering, before yielding.
   - If `enableYieldingBeforePassive` is false, the effect is still expected to be executed after paint, as in the previous behavior.

This change potentially improves the consistency and efficiency of React's work scheduling, particularly for passive effects. It may have implications for the timing of effect execution in certain scenarios, which developers might need to be aware of when this feature is enabled.
