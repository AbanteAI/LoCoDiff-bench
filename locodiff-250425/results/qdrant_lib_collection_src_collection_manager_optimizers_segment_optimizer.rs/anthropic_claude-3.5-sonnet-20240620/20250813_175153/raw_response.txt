Here is a summary of the key changes made to the `segment_optimizer.rs` file through this commit history:

1. Added support for optimizing segments with multiple named vectors per point.

2. Refactored segment configuration to handle vector-specific HNSW and quantization settings.

3. Improved handling of on-disk vs in-memory storage decisions based on segment size thresholds.

4. Added support for sparse vector indexing and optimization.

5. Implemented defragmentation of tenant data during optimization.

6. Added CPU and I/O resource management to control concurrency of optimization tasks.

7. Improved error handling and cancellation logic for optimization tasks.

8. Added telemetry and measurement of optimization operations.

9. Updated to handle changes in underlying segment implementation, like payload indexing and storage.

10. Improved handling of version numbers when propagating changes from proxy segments.

11. Removed explicit prefaulting of mmap pages after optimization.

12. Added support for clearing disk cache after optimization to manage memory usage.

The overall trend has been towards more fine-grained control over optimization behavior, better resource management, and improved handling of complex segment configurations. The code has also been updated to keep pace with changes in the underlying segment implementation and Rust language features.
