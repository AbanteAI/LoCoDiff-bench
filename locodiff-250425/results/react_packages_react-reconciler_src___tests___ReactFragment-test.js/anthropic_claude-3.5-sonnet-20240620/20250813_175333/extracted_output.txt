Here's a summary of the key changes made to the ReactFragment-test.js file:

1. Added imports for React, ReactNoop, waitForAll, and assertConsoleErrorDev.

2. Updated the beforeEach function to reset modules and require necessary dependencies.

3. Converted synchronous tests to async using async/await syntax.

4. Replaced expect(Scheduler).toFlushWithoutYielding() calls with await waitForAll([]).

5. Updated assertions to use ReactNoop.toMatchRenderedOutput() instead of checking ReactNoop.getChildren() directly.

6. Added a new test case for preserving state when adding a fragment wrapped in React.lazy.

7. Updated error assertions to use assertConsoleErrorDev instead of expect().toErrorDev().

8. Removed checks related to the enableOwnerStacks flag, as it was removed.

9. Updated error messages to reflect changes in React's warning format and stack trace information.

These changes modernize the test suite, make it more robust, and align it with current React testing best practices. The tests now use async/await, have more precise assertions, and handle error cases more accurately.
