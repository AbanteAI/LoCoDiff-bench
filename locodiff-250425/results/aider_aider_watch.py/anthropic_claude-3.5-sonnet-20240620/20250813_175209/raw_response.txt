Here's a summary of the changes made to the `aider/watch.py` file:

1. The AI comment pattern regex was updated to include Lisp-style comments:
   ```python
   ai_comment_pattern = re.compile(r"(?:#|//|--|;+) *(ai\b.*|ai\b.*|.*\bai[?!]?) *$", re.IGNORECASE)
   ```

2. In the `get_ai_comments` method, the comment processing was updated to handle Lisp semicolon comments:
   ```python
   comment = comment.lstrip("/#-;")  # Added semicolon for Lisp comments
   ```

These changes allow the file watcher to detect AI comments in Lisp-style code files, which use semicolons (`;`) for comments. The rest of the file's functionality remains the same, including the handling of other comment styles and the overall file watching process.
