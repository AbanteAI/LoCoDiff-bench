Here's a summary of the key changes made to the TlaEditor component:

1. The component now accepts `isEmbed` as a prop.

2. The `fileOpenState` prop was removed, along with related logic for handling different file open modes.

3. The `useSync` hook was updated to use a stable `getUserToken` function to prevent unnecessary remounts.

4. Deep link handling was improved to respect the deep link parameter even for previously visited files.

5. The `isShapeHidden` prop was replaced with `getShapeVisibility` to allow more granular control over shape visibility.

6. Some temporary components and logic related to preview experiences were removed.

7. The `onDocumentChange` prop and related logic were removed.

8. Asset handling was updated to associate assets with specific files.

9. Session state updates were made less frequent (throttled to 5 seconds) to reduce database queries.

10. File edit updates were also throttled (to 10 seconds) to reduce database load.

11. The component now ensures that any pending updates are flushed before unmounting or navigating away.

These changes reflect improvements in performance, stability, and functionality of the TlaEditor component within the larger application context.
