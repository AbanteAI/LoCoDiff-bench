Here are the key changes made to the `ReactUpdates-test.js` file over time:

1. The test suite was updated to use modern React APIs like `createRoot` instead of legacy rendering methods.

2. Many tests were converted to use async/await and the `act` helper for handling asynchronous updates.

3. Error handling and assertion logic was updated, particularly around infinite update loops and maximum update depth errors.

4. Tests were added for new features like concurrent mode and React hooks.

5. Some tests were updated to account for changes in React's internal behavior, like batching of updates.

6. Assertion helpers like `assertLog` and `assertConsoleErrorDev` were introduced to simplify testing patterns.

7. Tests related to component stacks and owner stacks were updated as those APIs evolved.

8. Some tests were modified to work with new feature flags and experimental builds of React.

9. The nested update limit was temporarily increased and then reverted.

10. Tests for deprecated APIs like `findDOMNode` were removed or updated.

11. Error message assertions were updated to match changes in React's warning and error messages.

The overall trend was toward more async testing patterns, better handling of concurrent mode behavior, and adapting to changes in React's public and internal APIs. The test suite was continuously maintained to ensure it covered new React features and edge cases as the library evolved.
