Looking at the git log for `aider/__init__.py`, I can trace the current state of the file through its history:

1. **Initial creation** (commit 3ff28a111): The file was created empty
2. **Added version variable** (commit 79f6be216): Added `__version__ = "0.6.2"`
3. **Version handling evolution**: Throughout the history, the file has primarily contained version information that gets updated regularly
4. **Recent changes** (commits from 2439891ee onward): The file now includes more sophisticated version handling with fallback logic

The current state of the file after the last commit (c2d8d5dc82dbf07cc33811795c213a0a056fb83b) is:

```python
from packaging import version

__version__ = "0.82.3.dev"
safe_version = __version__

try:
    from aider._version import __version__
except Exception:
    __version__ = safe_version + "+import"

if type(__version__) is not str:
    __version__ = safe_version + "+type"
else:
    try:
        if version.parse(__version__) < version.parse(safe_version):
            __version__ = safe_version + "+less"
    except Exception:
        __version__ = safe_version + "+parse"

__all__ = [__version__]
```
