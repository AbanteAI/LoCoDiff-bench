Here's a summary of the key changes made to the `query_checker.rs` file in the Qdrant segment library over time:

1. Initial implementation of payload query checking logic.

2. Added support for geo-based filtering conditions.

3. Refactored to use a generic payload storage interface.

4. Added support for nested object filtering.

5. Implemented "min should" clause filtering.

6. Added datetime payload indexing and filtering.

7. Introduced "has vector" filtering condition.

8. Refactored to use a `JsonPath` type for payload keys.

9. Added IO measurement capabilities.

10. Introduced `VectorName` type alias.

11. Added `payload_json!` macro for easier payload construction in tests.

12. Implemented "is empty" and "is null" payload indexing.

13. Added hardware counter for IO measurements in fulltext indexing.

14. Switched to using `ahash` for sets holding point IDs and offsets.

The file evolved to support more advanced filtering capabilities, improved performance through indexing, and added instrumentation for IO measurements. The changes reflect Qdrant's development in supporting more complex queries and optimizing search operations.
