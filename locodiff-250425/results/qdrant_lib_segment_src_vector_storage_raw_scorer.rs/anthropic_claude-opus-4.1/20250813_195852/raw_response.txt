Looking at this code, I can see that `raw_scorer.rs` implements a scoring system for vector similarity search in Qdrant. Here's what this file contains:

## Main Purpose
This file provides the infrastructure for scoring vectors against query vectors during search operations. It acts as a bridge between vector storage and the actual scoring logic.

## Key Components

### 1. **RawScorer Trait**
The main trait that defines the interface for scoring operations:
- `score_points`: Scores a batch of points
- `score_points_unfiltered`: Scores points without filtering deleted ones
- `check_vector`: Checks if a vector is valid (not deleted)
- `score_point`: Scores a single point
- `score_internal`: Computes distance between two stored points
- `peek_top_iter`: Finds top-k best scoring points from an iterator
- `peek_top_all`: Finds top-k best scoring points from all points

### 2. **RawScorerImpl**
The concrete implementation that combines:
- A query scorer (handles the actual scoring logic)
- Deletion tracking (via BitSlices for deleted points and vectors)
- Cancellation support (via AtomicBool)

### 3. **Factory Functions**
Multiple factory functions create appropriate scorers based on:
- **Storage type**: Dense, Sparse, Multi-vector
- **Data type**: Float32, Byte, Half (Float16)
- **Query type**: Nearest neighbor, Recommendation, Discovery, Context
- **Distance metric**: Cosine, Euclidean, Dot Product, Manhattan

### 4. **Architecture**
The code follows a layered architecture (as shown in the ASCII diagram):
```
RawScorer → QueryScorer → Metric
```
- **RawScorer**: Handles deletions and access patterns
- **QueryScorer**: Manages query logic and vector storage
- **Metric**: Implements specific distance calculations

### 5. **Optimization Features**
- **Batch processing**: Processes vectors in batches (VECTOR_READ_BATCH_SIZE) for better memory access patterns
- **Hardware counters**: Tracks performance metrics
- **Async support**: Linux-specific async I/O optimization for memory-mapped storage
- **Multiple storage backends**: Supports in-memory, memory-mapped, and appendable storage

## Key Functions

The main entry point is `new_raw_scorer()` which:
1. Takes a query vector and storage reference
2. Determines the appropriate scorer implementation based on storage type
3. Returns a boxed trait object for polymorphic usage

The scoring process efficiently handles:
- Deleted vectors (soft deletes)
- Different vector types (dense, sparse, multi-vector)
- Various data types for optimization (float, byte, half precision)
- Cancellation for long-running operations

This is a critical performance component in Qdrant's search functionality, optimized for different storage layouts and query types.
