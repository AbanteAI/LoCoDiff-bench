I'll trace through the history of Tab.zig to understand its evolution and current state.

## Summary of Tab.zig Evolution

The file has evolved significantly through several major phases:

### 1. Initial Implementation (2023-09-26 to 2023-10-31)
- Started as a basic skeleton for handling splits in GTK
- Added surface creation and tab management
- Implemented close buttons and wide-tab styling
- Added support for split surfaces using a `Child` union type (surface or paned)

### 2. Split Support Development (2023-10-31 to 2023-11-26)
- Refined parent-child relationships for splits
- Added `removeChild` and `setChild` methods
- Implemented proper cleanup/deinit for splits
- Added focus tracking for surfaces within tabs

### 3. Architectural Refactoring (2023-12-01 to 2024-11-15)
- Replaced the `child` field with a more flexible `elem` field
- Introduced `Surface.Container.Elem` type for unified handling
- Added proper GTK signal handling for tab destruction
- Implemented middle-click tab closing
- Added tab positioning configuration

### 4. Libadwaita Integration (2024-06-08 to 2024-09-18)
- Major refactor to support both GTK Notebook and Adwaita TabView
- Removed direct tab label management in favor of abstracted notebook interface
- Added support for tab pages and modern Adwaita features

### 5. Modern Features (2024-11-15 to 2025-03-18)
- Added PWD tooltip support
- Implemented close confirmation dialogs
- Migrated to zig-gobject bindings
- Improved type safety and modern API usage

## Current State Structure

```zig
const Tab = @This();

// Core fields
window: *Window,                    // Parent window
label_text: *gtk.Label,            // Tab label widget
box: *gtk.Box,                     // Container for tab content
elem: Surface.Container.Elem,      // Current element (surface or split)
focus_child: ?*Surface,            // Currently focused surface

// Key methods
pub fn create(...)                 // Allocate and initialize
pub fn init(...)                   // Initialize tab with surface
pub fn deinit(...)                 // Clean up resources
pub fn destroy(...)                // Deinit and deallocate
pub fn replaceElem(...)            // Replace current element
pub fn setTitleText(...)           // Update tab title
pub fn setTooltipText(...)         // Set tab tooltip
pub fn remove(...)                 // Remove tab from window
pub fn closeWithConfirmation(...)  // Close with user confirmation
```

The Tab represents a single tab in the terminal window that can contain either:
1. A single Surface (terminal)
2. A Split containing multiple Surfaces

The implementation has evolved from manual GTK C bindings to using modern zig-gobject bindings, providing better type safety and a more idiomatic Zig interface.
