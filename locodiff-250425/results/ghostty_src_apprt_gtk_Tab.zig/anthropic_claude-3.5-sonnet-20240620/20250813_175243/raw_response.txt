Here's a summary of the key changes made to the `Tab.zig` file over the course of these commits:

1. Initial implementation of the Tab struct for managing tabs in a GTK window.
2. Refactoring to use Adwaita's tab view when available.
3. Addition of close confirmation dialogs for tabs.
4. Conversion to use zig-gobject bindings instead of direct C bindings.
5. Various improvements and bug fixes, including:
   - Handling of split surfaces
   - Improved tab labeling and tooltips
   - Memory management improvements
   - Adwaita version-specific fixes

The final state of the file includes:

- A `Tab` struct representing a single tab in the window, which can contain one or more terminals due to splits.
- Methods for creating, initializing, and destroying tabs.
- Functions for managing the tab's content, including replacing elements and setting labels.
- A close confirmation mechanism that checks if any surface in the tab needs confirmation before closing.
- Use of zig-gobject bindings for GTK and GObject interactions.
- Event handling for tab destruction.

The code has evolved to be more modular, use modern GTK/Adwaita features when available, and provide a more robust tab management system for the terminal application.
