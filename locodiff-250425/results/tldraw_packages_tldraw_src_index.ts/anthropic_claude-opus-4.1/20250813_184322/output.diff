+Looking at this index.ts file, I can see that it exports a comprehensive set of components, utilities, and types from the tldraw library. The file has evolved significantly over time with many features being added, particularly around:
 
-import { registerTldrawLibraryVersion } from '@tldraw/editor'
-export { usePrefersReducedMotion } from './lib/tldraw_packages_tldraw_src_index.ts_extracted.txt (actual):
+- Accessibility improvements (a11y announcer, keyboard navigation for toolbars)
+- Rich text enhancements (custom extensions, text direction support)
+- Toolbar compliance improvements for keyboard navigation
+
+The file follows a clear organization pattern, grouping related exports together and using descriptive comments to separate sections. It also includes backward compatibility considerations and API evolution throughout its history.
