Here are the key changes made to the `ReactDOMRoot-test.js` file over time:

1. The test file was initially created to test the new `ReactDOMRoot` API.

2. Tests were added for rendering, unmounting, hydration, and various error cases.

3. The `createRoot` and `hydrateRoot` APIs were moved from `react-dom` to `react-dom/client`.

4. Tests were updated to use the new `act` and `waitFor` helpers from internal test utils.

5. Some tests related to legacy APIs like `render` and `hydrate` were removed.

6. Error messages and warnings were updated as the APIs evolved.

7. Tests were added for concurrent rendering behavior.

8. The `allowConcurrentByDefault` flag and related tests were removed.

9. More detailed hydration mismatch error messages were added.

10. Tests were updated to use new assertion helpers like `assertLog` and `assertConsoleErrorDev`.

11. Some tests were gated behind feature flags as new capabilities were added.

12. Owner stack information was added to hydration mismatch errors.

The overall trend was moving towards testing the new concurrent root APIs, improving error messages, and using more sophisticated testing utilities. The tests evolved alongside the implementation of the new React root API.
