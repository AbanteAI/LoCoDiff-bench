Looking at the `Termio.zig` file, I can see it's the main implementation for terminal I/O operations in Ghostty. Here's a summary of its key components and functionality:

## Main Components

1. **Terminal State Management**: Contains a `terminal` field that holds the abstract terminal emulator state (grid, cursor, modes, etc.)

2. **Backend/Subprocess**: Uses a `backend` field (typically `termio.Exec`) to manage the shell subprocess and PTY

3. **Stream Processing**: Contains a `terminal_stream` that parses escape sequences and handles terminal control codes

4. **Mailbox Communication**: Uses a mailbox system to communicate with other threads (renderer, surface)

5. **Configuration**: Has a `DerivedConfig` structure that holds terminal-specific settings derived from the main config

## Key Functions

### Initialization (`init`)
- Creates the terminal with specified grid size
- Sets up default modes (grapheme clustering, cursor blinking)
- Initializes color palettes and image storage limits
- Configures the backend and stream handler

### Thread Management
- `threadEnter`: Sets up thread-local data when entering the termio thread
- `threadExit`: Cleans up when exiting the thread

### Core Operations

**Resizing** (`resize`):
- Updates PTY size
- Notifies terminal state
- Sends size reports if enabled
- Updates renderer

**Output Processing** (`processOutput`):
- Handles data from the PTY
- Manages cursor reset timing
- Integrates with the inspector if present
- Processes escape sequences

**Screen Operations**:
- `clearScreen`: Clears terminal screen with optional history
- `scrollViewport`: Scrolls the terminal viewport
- `jumpToPrompt`: Navigates to command prompts

**Size Reporting** (`sizeReport`):
- Supports multiple reporting formats (Mode 2048, CSI 14t, CSI 16t, CSI 18t)
- Reports grid dimensions and pixel sizes

**Focus Management** (`focusGained`):
- Sends focus events when enabled
- Notifies backend of focus changes

**Error Handling** (`childExitedAbnormally`):
- Displays error messages when subprocess exits unexpectedly

## Communication

The module uses several communication channels:
- **Renderer mailbox**: For display updates
- **Surface mailbox**: For window-level events  
- **Writer/Mailbox**: For queuing writes to the PTY

## Stream Handler Integration

The `terminal_stream` field processes incoming data through a `StreamHandler` that:
- Parses escape sequences
- Updates terminal state
- Handles OSC (Operating System Command) sequences
- Manages cursor and color configurations

This is a central component that coordinates between the shell subprocess, terminal emulation logic, and the rendering/display systems in Ghostty.
