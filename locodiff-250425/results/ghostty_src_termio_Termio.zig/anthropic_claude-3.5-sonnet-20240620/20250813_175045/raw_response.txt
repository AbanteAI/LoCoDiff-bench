Here's a summary of the key changes made to the `Termio.zig` file across these commits:

1. The file structure and core functionality of the `Termio` struct were established, including initializing the terminal, handling resizing, processing output, and managing configuration.

2. The backend for handling I/O was abstracted, moving from a direct subprocess implementation to a more flexible `termio.Backend` interface.

3. The writer concept was introduced and later renamed to mailbox, providing a mechanism for inter-thread communication.

4. Size reporting and handling were improved, with the introduction of a unified `renderer.Size` struct to manage various size-related information.

5. Focus handling was added, allowing the terminal to respond to focus gain/loss events.

6. Configuration options were expanded, including support for cursor styles, colors, and grapheme width methods.

7. The initialization process was refined to set up default modes based on configuration.

8. Kitty graphics handling was improved, including clearing images when clearing the screen.

9. Selection clearing was added to the screen clearing process.

10. The async backend was made configurable, allowing users to choose between io_uring and epoll on Linux systems.

11. The codebase was updated for compatibility with Zig 0.14.

Throughout these changes, the `Termio` struct evolved to become a more flexible and feature-rich component, managing the core terminal functionality while interfacing with various other parts of the system like the renderer, backend I/O, and configuration.
