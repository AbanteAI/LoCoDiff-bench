Here's a summary of the key changes made to the `graphics_exec.zig` file for Kitty graphics support in Zed:

1. Initial implementation of basic Kitty graphics commands (query, transmit, display).

2. Added support for chunked image transmissions.

3. Implemented cursor movement after image placement.

4. Added virtual placements and relative placement options.

5. Improved error handling and response generation.

6. Added support for deleting images and placements.

7. Implemented proper handling of the 'q' (quiet) parameter for chunked transmissions.

8. Set default transmission format to RGBA.

9. Fixed issues with integer parsing for large values.

10. Corrected behavior to not respond to transmit commands without explicit image IDs.

11. Ensured temporary files for image transmission are named correctly per spec.

The file implements the core logic for executing Kitty graphics protocol commands, handling image transmission, storage, display, and deletion. It interfaces with the terminal's image storage and rendering systems to manage graphics in the terminal.
