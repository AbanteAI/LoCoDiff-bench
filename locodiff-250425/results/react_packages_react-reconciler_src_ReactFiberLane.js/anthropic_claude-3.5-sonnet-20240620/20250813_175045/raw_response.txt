The main changes to ReactFiberLane.js in this commit are:

1. Added a new `includesOnlySuspenseyCommitEligibleLanes` function:

```javascript
export function includesOnlySuspenseyCommitEligibleLanes(
  lanes: Lanes,
): boolean {
  return (
    (lanes & (TransitionLanes | RetryLanes | IdleLane | GestureLane)) === lanes
  );
}
```

This function checks if the given lanes only include lanes that are eligible for "suspensey" commits - specifically Transition lanes, Retry lanes, Idle lane, and Gesture lane.

2. The `GestureLane` is now included in the lanes checked by this new function, indicating that gesture transitions are now considered eligible for suspensey behavior like waiting for images to load before committing.

The commit message indicates this is part of adding support for "Suspensey Images" - waiting for images to decode before committing updates, but only for certain types of updates (transitions, retries, gestures, idle). This new function will likely be used to determine when to apply this behavior.
