Here are the key changes made to the LineShapeUtil class in this file:

1. The class now extends ShapeUtil<TLLineShape>.

2. Several methods were changed from property functions to regular methods:
   - hideResizeHandles()
   - hideRotateHandle() 
   - hideSelectionBoundsFg()
   - hideSelectionBoundsBg()

3. An onBeforeCreate method was added to prevent creating lines with identical start and end points.

4. The onHandleDrag method was updated to use maybeSnapToGrid when updating handle positions.

5. The component method now wraps the LineShapeSvg in an SVGContainer with a min width/height of 50px.

6. A getInterpolatedProps method was added to support animating between different line states.

7. The toSvg method was simplified to just return the LineShapeSvg component.

8. A canTabTo method was added that returns false, indicating line shapes can't be tabbed to for accessibility navigation.

9. Some internal helper functions like getGeometryForLineShape and LineShapeSvg were moved outside the class definition.

10. The use of WeakMapCache was changed to WeakCache.

These changes mostly relate to refactoring the shape util API, improving animation support, fixing some edge cases, and adding initial accessibility considerations. The core functionality of rendering and interacting with line shapes remains largely the same.
