Looking at the git history, I can see how `ReactDOMServerIntegrationHooks-test.js` has evolved over time. Here's what happened to the test:

## Summary

The test file **still exists** but has been significantly reduced in scope. Originally, it contained extensive tests for various React hooks, including a large section testing `useOpaqueIdentifier`. Over time:

1. **Major removal (Nov 2021)**: The `useOpaqueIdentifier` API and all its tests were removed in commit `75f3ddebf` when this experimental API was deprecated in favor of `useId`.

2. **Current state**: The file now contains tests for:
   - Basic hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`)
   - `useImperativeHandle`
   - `useInsertionEffect` 
   - `useLayoutEffect`
   - `useContext`
   - `useDebugValue`
   - `readContext` (internal API)
   - Various error cases and edge conditions

3. **Recent changes**: 
   - Tests for an experimental `useResourceEffect` (later merged into `useEffect` as a CRUD overload) were added and then removed in 2024-2025
   - Various maintenance updates (copyright headers, testing infrastructure, linting)

The test file went from ~2000 lines to ~900 lines, with the bulk of the reduction coming from the removal of `useOpaqueIdentifier` tests which made up about half the file. The remaining tests focus on verifying that hooks behave correctly during server-side rendering, particularly ensuring that effects don't run on the server and that state management works as expected.
