-//! Command launches sub-processes. This is an alternate implementation to the
-//! Zig std.process.Child since at the time of authoring this, std.process.Child
-//! didn't support the options necessary to spawn a shell attached to a pty.
-//!
-//! Consequently, I didn't implement a lot of features that std.process.Child
-//! supports because we didn't need them. Cross-platform subprocessing is not
-//! a trivial thing to implement (I've done it in three separate languages now)
-//! so if we want to replatform onto std.process.Child I'd love to do that.
-//! This was just the fastest way to get something built.
-//!
-//! Issues with std.process.Child:
-//!
-//!   * No pre_exec callback for logic after fork but before exec.
-//!   * posix_spawn is used for Mac, but doesn't support the necessary
-//!     features for tty setup.
