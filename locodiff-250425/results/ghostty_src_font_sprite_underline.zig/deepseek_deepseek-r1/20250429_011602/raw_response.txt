```zig
//! This file renders underline sprites. To draw underlines, we render the
//! full cell-width as a sprite and then draw it as a separate pass to the
//! text.
//!
//! We used to render the underlines directly in the GPU shaders but its
//! annoying to support multiple types of underlines and its also annoying
//! to maintain and debug another set of shaders for each renderer instead of
//! just relying on the glyph system we already need to support for text
//! anyways.
//!
//! This also renders strikethrough, so its really more generally a
//! "horizontal line" renderer.
