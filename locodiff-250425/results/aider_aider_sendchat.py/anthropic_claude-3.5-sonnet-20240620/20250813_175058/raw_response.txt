Here's the final state of the `aider/sendchat.py` file after all the commits:

```python
from aider.dump import dump  # noqa: F401
from aider.utils import format_messages


def sanity_check_messages(messages):
    """Check if messages alternate between user and assistant roles.
    System messages can be interspersed anywhere.
    Also verifies the last non-system message is from the user.
    Returns True if valid, False otherwise."""
    last_role = None
    last_non_system_role = None

    for msg in messages:
        role = msg.get("role")
        if role == "system":
            continue

        if last_role and role == last_role:
            turns = format_messages(messages)
            raise ValueError("Messages don't properly alternate user/assistant:\n\n" + turns)

        last_role = role
        last_non_system_role = role

    # Ensure last non-system message is from user
    return last_non_system_role == "user"


def ensure_alternating_roles(messages):
    """Ensure messages alternate between 'assistant' and 'user' roles.

    if not messages:
        return messages

    fixed_messages = []
    prev_role = None

    for msg in messages:

This file now contains two main functions:

1. `sanity_check_messages`: Checks if the messages alternate properly between user and assistant roles, with system messages allowed anywhere.

2. `ensure_alternating_roles`: Ensures that the messages alternate between assistant and user roles by inserting empty messages when necessary.

The file no longer contains the `send_completion` and `simple_send_with_retries` functions, as they have been moved to the `models.py` file. The `RETRY_TIMEOUT` constant has also been moved to `models.py`.
