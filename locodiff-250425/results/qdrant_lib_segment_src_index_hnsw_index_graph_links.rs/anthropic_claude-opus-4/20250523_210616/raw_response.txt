Looking at this file, I can see it's implementing the graph links storage for an HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index used in Qdrant, a vector database. Here's what the main components do:

## Purpose
This module manages the storage and access of graph links in the HNSW index structure. The links represent connections between points in different layers of the hierarchical graph.

## Key Components

### 1. **GraphLinks** - Main structure
- Manages graph links data either in RAM or memory-mapped from disk
- Uses the `self_cell` pattern to store both the data and a view over it
- Provides methods to:
  - Load from file (with option for memory mapping)
  - Access links for a specific point and level
  - Get the level of a point
  - Convert back to edges format

### 2. **GraphLinksFormat** - Storage format enum
```rust
pub enum GraphLinksFormat {
    Plain,      // Uncompressed format
    Compressed, // Compressed format using bitpacking
}
```

### 3. **GraphLinksView** - View over the data
- Provides actual access logic to the stored links
- Handles both compressed and uncompressed formats
- Contains:
  - `reindex`: Maps point IDs to their position in the storage
  - `compression`: Either uncompressed links/offsets or compressed data
  - `level_offsets`: Offsets for each level in the hierarchy

### 4. **Storage Layout**
The file comment explains the storage structure:
```
points to lvl   sorted points
0 -> 0          142350
1 -> 4    
2 -> 2    
3 -> 2    
4 -> 3    
5 -> 1    

Links are stored per level, with reindexing for efficient access
```

### 5. **Compression**
- Uses bitpacking for links compression
- Separate compression for offsets using ordered bitpacking
- Maintains sorted/unsorted split for better compression

## Key Methods

- `load_from_file()`: Loads graph links from disk, optionally memory-mapping
- `links()`: Returns an iterator over links for a point at a specific level
- `point_level()`: Gets the maximum level for a point
- `populate()`: Pre-loads memory-mapped data into RAM cache
- `into_edges()`: Converts back to edge list format

The implementation is optimized for read performance with efficient memory layout and optional compression to reduce storage size while maintaining fast access patterns needed for HNSW search operations.
