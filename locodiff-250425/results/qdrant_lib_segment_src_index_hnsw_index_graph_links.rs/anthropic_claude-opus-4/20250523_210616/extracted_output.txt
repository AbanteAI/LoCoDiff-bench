pub enum GraphLinksFormat {
    Plain,      // Uncompressed format
    Compressed, // Compressed format using bitpacking
}
```

### 3. **GraphLinksView** - View over the data
- Provides actual access logic to the stored links
- Handles both compressed and uncompressed formats
- Contains:
  - `reindex`: Maps point IDs to their position in the storage
  - `compression`: Either uncompressed links/offsets or compressed data
  - `level_offsets`: Offsets for each level in the hierarchy

### 4. **Storage Layout**
The file comment explains the storage structure:
```
points to lvl   sorted points
0 -> 0          142350
1 -> 4    
2 -> 2    
3 -> 2    
4 -> 3    
5 -> 1    

Links are stored per level, with reindexing for efficient access
