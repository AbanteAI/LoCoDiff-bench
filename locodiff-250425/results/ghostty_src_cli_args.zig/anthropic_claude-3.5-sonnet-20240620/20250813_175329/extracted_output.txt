Here's a summary of the key changes to the `src/cli/args.zig` file:

1. Added support for parsing tagged unions and auto structs.
2. Introduced a mechanism for renaming config fields to maintain backwards compatibility.
3. Added support for `init` function to set default values for structs.
4. Improved error handling and diagnostic messages.
5. Added support for parsing more integer types (u21, u64, etc.).
6. Updated to work with newer Zig language features and syntax.
7. Added support for ignoring action arguments (starting with '+').
8. Improved handling of empty values and optional fields.
9. Added ability to list valid options for enum fields in error messages.
10. Various bug fixes and optimizations.

The file now provides a more robust and flexible configuration parsing system, with better error reporting and backwards compatibility features. It can handle a wider variety of data types and struct layouts, and has improved support for custom parsing logic through `parseCLI` and `init` functions.
