+    Implement Partial Hydration for Activity (#32863)
+    
+    Stacked on #32862 and #32842.
+    
+    This means that Activity boundaries now act as boundaries which can have
+    their effects mounted independently. Just like Suspense boundaries, we
+    hydrate the outer content first and then start hydrating the content in
+    an Offscreen lane. Flowing props or interacting with the content
+    increases the priority just like Suspense boundaries.
+    
+    This skips emitting even the comments for `<Activity mode="hidden">` so
+    we don't hydrate those. Instead those are deferred to a later client
+    render.
+    
+    The implementation are just forked copies of the SuspenseComponent
+    branches and then carefully going through each line and tweaking it.
+    
+    The main interesting bit is that, unlike Suspense, Activity boundaries
+    don't have fallbacks so all those branches where you might commit a
+    suspended tree disappears. Instead, if something suspends while
+    hydration, we can just leave the dehydrated content in place. However,
+    if something does suspend during client rendering then it should bubble
+    up to the parent. Therefore, we have to be careful to only
+    pushSuspenseHandler when hydrating. That's really the main difference.
+    
+    This just uses the existing basic Activity tests but I've started work
+    on port all of the applicable Suspense tests in SelectiveHydration-test
+    and PartialHydration-test to Activity versions.
+```
+
+This commit modifies the `ReactFiberUnwindWork.js` file. Therefore, I must output the content of the file as it exists after this commit.
+
+Now, I will write the exact content of the file.
