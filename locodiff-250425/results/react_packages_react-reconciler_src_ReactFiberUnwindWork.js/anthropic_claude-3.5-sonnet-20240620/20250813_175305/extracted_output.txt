This commit makes the following changes to the `ReactFiberUnwindWork.js` file:

1. Adds support for the new `ActivityComponent` type:

   - Imports `ActivityState` type from `./ReactFiberActivityComponent`.
   - Adds a new case for `ActivityComponent` in the `unwindWork` function.
   - Adds handling for `ActivityComponent` in the `unwindInterruptedWork` function.

2. In the `unwindWork` function, for `ActivityComponent`:
   - Checks if there's an `activityState` in `memoizedState`.
   - If so, it pops the suspense handler and resets the hydration state.
   - Handles the `ShouldCapture` flag similar to `SuspenseComponent`.

3. In the `unwindInterruptedWork` function, for `ActivityComponent`:
   - Checks if `memoizedState` is not null.
   - If so, it pops the suspense handler.

These changes implement partial hydration for Activity components, allowing them to have their effects mounted independently, similar to Suspense boundaries. The implementation is based on the existing Suspense component logic, with adjustments for the specific behavior of Activity components.

The main difference noted is that Activity boundaries don't have fallbacks, so the logic for committing suspended trees is removed. Instead, if something suspends during hydration, the dehydrated content can be left in place. However, suspensions during client rendering should bubble up to the parent.

This commit is part of a larger change to implement partial hydration for Activity components, improving the flexibility and performance of React's hydration process.
