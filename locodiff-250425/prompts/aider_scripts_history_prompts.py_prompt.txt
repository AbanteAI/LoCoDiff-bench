# Instructions

You are being benchmarked. You will see the output of a git log command, and from that must infer the current state of a file. Think carefully, as you must output the exact state of the file to earn full marks.

**Important:** Your goal is to reproduce the file's content *exactly* as it exists at the final commit, even if the code appears broken, buggy, or contains obvious errors. Do **not** try to "fix" the code. Attempting to correct issues will result in a poor score, as this benchmark evaluates your ability to reproduce the precise state of the file based on its history.

# Required Response Format

Wrap the content of the file in triple backticks (```). Any text outside the final closing backticks will be ignored. End your response after outputting the closing backticks.

# Example Response

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
print('Hello, world!')
```

# File History
